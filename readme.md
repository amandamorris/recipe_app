#Intro#
Welcome to Relishd, a webapp where users can search for, save, and categorize
recipes!  I built this as my final project for Hackbright Academy, a coding
bootcamp for women.

##Tech stack:##
Flask
PostgreSQL
Python
SQLAlchemy
Javascript
JQuery
Boostrap

This app uses the Spoonacular API.  To run this app, you'll need to get an API
key from Mashape (https://market.mashape.com/spoonacular/recipe-food-nutrition).
